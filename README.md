# Module 9A Build Your First React Component

## Gustavo Corona
### README.md made July 26, 2025

## Description
This is a React app created using Vite that renders a UserProfile component. The component includes a name, bio, and image styled with inline CSS.

## What I Learned
- How to set up a React project using Vite
- How to write and structure a functional React component
- How to use JSX and inline styles
- How to render a component in App.jsx

## Challenges
I mostly had styling issues getting the profile card to be centered and in view or not being too stretch or having to scroll down to find it , and also getting the images to work for the profile pics, since the link default example image didnt work I decided to just upload images straight into the repo.
